### Veo 2 Visual Prompt

```
Cinematic educational animation. Clean, modern flat-design style with a blue color palette.

Scene 1: A young professional at a coffee shop looking at their phone, opens an investing app, and buys their first stock — show the stock price floating up as a hologram above the phone.

Scene 2: Aerial view of the New York Stock Exchange building transitioning into a digital visualization of buy/sell orders flowing as glowing particles on a dark background.

Scene 3: Three glass jars on a wooden table labeled "Stocks", "Bonds", "ETFs" — coins fall into each jar at different rates, the ETF jar fills steadily.

Scene 4: A large thermometer-style gauge showing a market going from green "Bull" at the top to red "Bear" at the bottom, with historical years floating by (2008, 2020, 2024).

### Narration Script

**[HOOK — 0:00]**  
"You use Amazon, drink Starbucks, scroll on your iPhone — what if you owned a piece of each of those companies?"

**[WHAT IS THE STOCK MARKET — 0:15]**  
The stock market is basically a supermarket for company ownership. When you buy a "share," you're buying a tiny slice of a real business. If that business grows, your slice becomes more valuable.

**[HOW EXCHANGES WORK — 0:45]**  
Exchanges like the NYSE and NASDAQ are the marketplaces where buyers meet sellers — like eBay, but for stocks. Market makers keep things flowing by always offering to buy and sell, and the difference between the buy and sell price is called the "spread."

**[STOCKS, BONDS & ETFS — 1:15]**  
There are three building blocks every investor should know:
- **Stocks** = you own a piece of the company
- **Bonds** = you're lending money to a company or government, and they pay you interest
- **ETFs** = a basket of many stocks bundled together — instant diversification

**[REAL-LIFE EXAMPLE — 1:45]**  
If you'd invested $1,000 in the S&P 500 in 2015, it would be worth about $2,500 today. That's without picking any individual stocks.

**[BULL VS BEAR — 2:00]**  
Markets go up about 75% of the time historically. A "bull market" means prices are rising. A "bear market" means they've dropped 20% or more. Crashes are temporary — growth is the long-term trend.

**[ORDERS — 2:30]**  
When you're ready to buy, you have two main choices:
- **Market order** = "buy now at whatever the current price is"
- **Limit order** = "only buy if the price drops to the level I set"

**[OUTRO — 3:00]**  
"You don't need to be rich to start — you need to start to be rich."

## 📊 Video 2: Technical Analysis — *"Reading the Market's Body Language"*

### Veo 2 Visual Prompt

```
Sleek financial animation with a purple/dark theme.

Scene 1: A doctor reading an EKG monitor, which morphs into a stock candlestick chart — implying "charts are the heartbeat of the market."

Scene 2: Close-up of Japanese candlesticks forming on a chart in real-time — green candles rising, then a red doji candle appearing (moment of indecision), followed by a hammer candle bouncing off a glowing blue horizontal support line.

Scene 3: A glass floor/ceiling metaphor — a ball bouncing off a glass floor (support) then hitting a glass ceiling (resistance), the ceiling eventually shatters as the ball breaks through (breakout).

Scene 4: Mountain landscape where hiking trails trace upward trend lines along ridges, with a drone flying through a price channel between two parallel mountain paths.

Scene 5: A time-lapse of multiple screens showing daily, weekly, and monthly charts side by side, zooming out to reveal a trader analyzing all three simultaneously.

Dark background, neon chart lines, professional trading desk atmosphere. 4K quality.
```

### Narration Script

**[HOOK — 0:00]**  
"Every stock price tells a story — technical analysis is how you read it, like reading body language in a conversation."

**[CANDLESTICKS — 0:15]**  
Candlestick charts were invented by Japanese rice traders over 300 years ago. Each candle represents one day's drama — the open, high, low, and close. Green means the price went up. Red means it went down. The "wicks" show how far the price swung before settling.

**[REAL-LIFE EXAMPLE — 0:45]**  
A "hammer" candle appeared on Tesla's chart in March 2020, signaling the bottom. Tesla then went up 700% over the next year.

**[SUPPORT & RESISTANCE — 1:10]**  
Think of support as a trampoline — prices bounce up when they hit it. Resistance is like a ceiling — prices get pushed back down. When a ceiling finally breaks, it often becomes the new floor. Round numbers like $100 or $50 tend to act as psychological barriers.

**[PATTERNS — 1:45]**  
Chart patterns are shapes that repeat because human psychology doesn't change:
- **Head & Shoulders** = someone standing up then sitting back down — signals a reversal
- **Double bottom** = a "W" shape — the market tried to go lower twice and failed
- **Cup & handle** = a rounded bottom followed by a small dip — often signals a breakout

**[VOLUME — 2:15]**  
Volume is the lie detector of the market. Price going up on high volume means real conviction — lots of buyers believe in the move. Price going up on low volume is suspicious — like a party with no guests.

**[MULTI-TIMEFRAME — 2:45]**  
Looking at multiple timeframes is like Google Maps. The monthly chart shows you the highway direction. The weekly shows the route. The daily shows the individual turns. Always check the bigger picture first.

**[OUTRO — 3:15]**  
"Charts don't predict the future — they show you what other investors are thinking right now."

## 📈 Video 3: Popular Indicators — *"Your Trading Dashboard Explained"*

### Veo 2 Visual Prompt

```
Modern data-dashboard animation with green/emerald color theme.

Scene 1: A car dashboard lighting up — speedometer morphs into RSI gauge, fuel gauge into MACD histogram, rearview mirror shows a moving average line trailing behind the car on the road.

Scene 2: Two glowing lines (fast EMA and slow SMA) weaving around a price chart — they cross and a golden flash appears (Golden Cross), then later a dark flash (Death Cross).

Scene 3: A rubber band stretching wider and wider (Bollinger Bands expanding) around a price line, then snapping back to squeeze tight, followed by an explosive breakout upward.

Scene 4: A weather forecast screen showing the Ichimoku Cloud — thick green cloud overhead labeled "bullish", price walking above it like sunshine, then clouds turning red as price drops below.

Scene 5: A mixing board / DJ console where each slider represents a different indicator — a trader adjusts 3 sliders (trend, momentum, volume) to find the perfect signal combination.

Futuristic holographic displays, clean data visualization aesthetic. 4K quality.
```

### Narration Script

**[HOOK — 0:00]**  
"You wouldn't drive a car without a speedometer and fuel gauge — indicators are your trading dashboard."

**[MOVING AVERAGES — 0:15]**  
A moving average smooths out the noise and shows you the trend. The 200-day moving average is like a long-term GPS — if the price is above it, the road ahead is generally positive. When the 50-day crosses above the 200-day, it's called a "Golden Cross" — historically, this leads to 8–15% gains.

**[RSI — 0:50]**  
The RSI is like a "tiredness meter" for a stock. Above 70 means the stock is exhausted — it's been running too hard (overbought). Below 30 means it's been beaten down too much (oversold). It doesn't mean "sell immediately" or "buy immediately" — it means "pay attention."

**[MACD — 1:20]**  
Think of MACD as two runners on a track. When the fast runner crosses ahead of the slow one, momentum is shifting upward — it's like a green traffic light. When the fast one falls behind, momentum is fading.

**[BOLLINGER BANDS — 1:50]**  
Bollinger Bands wrap around a stock's price like a rubber band. When they squeeze tight, it means the stock has been quiet — but something big is about to happen. It's the "calm before the storm." 95% of all price action stays within the bands.

**[REAL-LIFE EXAMPLE — 2:15]**  
In January 2023, Apple's RSI hit 28 (oversold) while MACD showed a bullish crossover. Two signals pointing the same direction. Apple rallied 40% that year.

**[COMBINING INDICATORS — 2:40]**  
Never rely on just one indicator. Use 2–3 from different families:
- One for **trend** (Moving Average)
- One for **momentum** (RSI)
- One for **volume** (OBV)
If they all agree, you have a much stronger signal.

**[OUTRO — 3:10]**  
"Indicators don't give you answers — they give you better questions to ask."

## 💰 Video 4: Investment Strategies — *"Finding Your Investing Style"*

### Veo 2 Visual Prompt

```
Warm, golden-toned lifestyle animation.

Scene 1: Split screen of two investors — left: Warren Buffett-style character in a library reading annual reports calmly (value investing), right: a surfer catching a wave that transforms into a rising stock chart (momentum trading).

Scene 2: A piggy bank on a table with coins dropping in regularly like clockwork, rain or shine — sunny days and stormy days pass through a window but the coins keep dropping (DCA).

Scene 3: A tree growing over time-lapse from a seed to a massive oak, with dividend payments appearing as falling golden leaves that replant themselves and grow new saplings around the original tree (DRIP compounding).

Scene 4: A clothing store with seasonal sections rotating — spring jackets move to the front (early cycle sectors), summer gear follows (mid cycle), winter coats last (late cycle/recession defensives).

Scene 5: A balanced scale with different colored blocks (stocks, bonds, international, real estate) being carefully stacked — the scale stays perfectly balanced as the person adds each block.

Warm lighting, aspirational feel, mix of real-world metaphors. 4K quality.
```

### Narration Script

**[HOOK — 0:00]**  
"There's no single 'best' strategy — the best one is the one you'll actually stick with."

**[VALUE INVESTING — 0:15]**  
This is Warren Buffett's approach — buy great companies when they're "on sale." Like buying a $100 bill for $70. The key is patience. Buffett has held Coca-Cola for over 30 years. Look for companies with low P/E ratios, strong brands, and consistent profits.

**[GROWTH INVESTING — 0:45]**  
Growth investors bet on the future — companies growing revenue 20%+ per year. The risk is higher, but so is the reward. Amazon lost money for years and its stock dropped 93% in the dot-com crash. Investors who held through that became millionaires.

**[DCA — 1:15]**  
Dollar-Cost Averaging means investing a fixed amount every month, no matter what the market is doing. When prices drop, your money buys more shares. Studies show DCA beats "timing the market" about 66% of the time.

**[REAL-LIFE EXAMPLE — 1:40]**  
$500 per month into the S&P 500 since 2010. That's about $180,000 invested. Today? Worth over $350,000. You didn't need to pick a single stock.

**[DIVIDEND INVESTING — 2:00]**  
Dividend investing means getting paid to wait. Coca-Cola has raised its dividend for over 60 consecutive years. Reinvesting those dividends (called DRIP) turns $10,000 into over $300,000 in 30 years through the power of compounding.

**[INDEX INVESTING — 2:30]**  
Here's a shocking fact: over 90% of professional fund managers fail to beat the S&P 500 over 15 years. Warren Buffett himself recommends index funds for most people. Low fees, broad diversification, and historically 10% annual returns.

**[OUTRO — 3:00]**  
"The best time to start investing was 10 years ago. The second best time is today."

## 🧮 Video 5: Fundamental Analysis — *"Become Your Own Stock Analyst"*

### Veo 2 Visual Prompt

```
Clean, professional cyan/teal animation with financial data aesthetics.

Scene 1: A detective with a magnifying glass examining a company's building — the walls become transparent revealing three floating documents: Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow Statement, each glowing a different color.

Scene 2: A grocery store price tag on a box of cereal showing "$5" morphs into a stock with P/E ratio of 25 — the narrator explains "you're paying $25 for every $1 of earnings" — two identical cereal boxes appear, one priced $5 (P/E 15, value) and one $12 (P/E 40, growth).

Scene 3: A hospital scene — a doctor (analyst) checking a company's vital signs: heart rate (revenue growth), blood pressure (debt-to-equity), oxygen level (free cash flow) — green checkmarks or red warnings appear on each metric.

Scene 4: A crystal ball showing future cash flows as floating dollar bills, each one slightly smaller than the last (time value of money / DCF), all flowing into a funnel that outputs a single number: "Intrinsic Value = $142."

Scene 5: Earnings season — a stage with a curtain lifting revealing a company CEO, audience reactions (stock price) jumping on "beat" and dropping on "miss," with a spotlight on "forward guidance."

Corporate but approachable aesthetic, infographic-style data visualization. 4K quality.
```

### Narration Script

**[HOOK — 0:00]**  
"Would you buy a restaurant without checking if it's profitable? That's what buying a stock without fundamental analysis is."

**[FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — 0:15]**  
Every public company publishes three key documents:
- **Income Statement** = "How much did we earn?" (revenue, expenses, profit)
- **Balance Sheet** = "What do we own vs what do we owe?" (assets vs liabilities)
- **Cash Flow Statement** = "How much actual cash came in and went out?"

**[P/E RATIO — 0:50]**  
The P/E ratio is the most popular metric in investing. If a stock has a P/E of 25, you're paying $25 for every $1 the company earns. Low P/E (10–15) might mean the stock is cheap. High P/E (30+) means investors expect big growth ahead.

**[REAL-LIFE EXAMPLE — 1:15]**  
In late 2022, Meta (Facebook) traded at a P/E of just 13 — while competitors averaged 25. The market thought Meta was doomed. Investors who bought anyway saw a 180% return in one year.

**[FREE CASH FLOW — 1:40]**  
Earnings can be manipulated with accounting tricks, but cash can't lie. Free Cash Flow is the actual money left after running the business and maintaining equipment. If a company shows profits but negative free cash flow — that's a red flag.

**[DCF SIMPLIFIED — 2:10]**  
What's a lemonade stand worth? If it makes $100 per year for 10 years, is it worth $1,000? Not exactly — because $100 next year is worth less than $100 today due to inflation and risk. A DCF model accounts for this by "discounting" future cash flows back to today's value.

**[EARNINGS SEASON — 2:45]**  
Every quarter, companies reveal their results. But here's what most beginners don't know: what moves the stock isn't the past numbers — it's the **forward guidance**. What does management expect for NEXT quarter? That's what really matters.

**[OUTRO — 3:15]**  
"Numbers don't lie — but you need to know which numbers to look at."

## ⚠️ Video 6: Risk Management — *"The Art of Not Losing Money"*

### Veo 2 Visual Prompt

```
Dramatic red/dark-themed animation with high contrast.

Scene 1: A tightrope walker over a canyon — no safety net at first (reckless trading), then a net appears below (stop-loss), then the rope widens (position sizing), then walls appear on both sides (diversification) — showing layers of protection.

Scene 2: Two side-by-side bar charts racing downward — Left: "Trader A" loses 10% with 1-2% risk per trade, recovers quickly. Right: "Trader B" loses 50%, and needs a 100% gain just to break even — the asymmetric math visualized as a seesaw that becomes harder to lift.

Scene 3: A basket of eggs, someone puts all eggs in one basket which falls and shatters — then rewind — eggs distributed across 5 different baskets in different locations, one basket falls but the others are safe.

Scene 4: A weather forecast screen showing "Storm ahead" (VIX spike) — a sailor checks their instruments (beta, correlation matrix) and adjusts their sails accordingly rather than heading back to shore.

Scene 5: Two versions of the same trader — left: emotional, checking phone every minute, panic-selling at a loss; right: calm, following a written plan, closing the laptop and going for a walk.

Red and green color contrast, cinematic lighting, impactful emotional tone. 4K quality.
```

### Narration Script

**[HOOK — 0:00]**  
"Warren Buffett's Rule #1: Never lose money. Rule #2: Never forget Rule #1. Here's why that math is brutally real."

**[THE ASYMMETRIC MATH — 0:15]**  
This is the most important concept in all of investing:
- Lose 10%? You need 11% to recover.
- Lose 25%? You need 33%.
- Lose 50%? You need 100% — a double — just to get back to where you started.
- Lose 90%? You need 900%.
Capital preservation is everything.

**[POSITION SIZING — 0:50]**  
The 1–2% Rule: never risk more than 1–2% of your total account on a single trade. With a $10,000 account and 1% risk, you'd only risk $100 per trade. Even 10 losses in a row — which is extremely unlikely — you still have $9,000. With 10% risk per trade? Ten losses and you're broke.

**[REAL-LIFE EXAMPLE — 1:20]**  
In 2008, the S&P 500 dropped 57%. Investors who panicked and sold locked in those losses permanently. Investors who held on recovered everything by 2013 — and had doubled their money by 2018.

**[STOP-LOSS — 1:45]**  
A stop-loss is your emergency exit — set it BEFORE you enter a trade. Decide in advance: "If this stock drops to $45, I'm out." A trailing stop is even smarter — it follows the price up but catches you if it falls, like a safety ratchet on a climbing wall.

**[DIVERSIFICATION — 2:15]**  
Don't own 20 tech stocks and call yourself diversified. True diversification means mixing assets that don't move together:
- US stocks + international stocks
- Stocks + bonds
- Large caps + small caps
If everything in your portfolio goes up and down at the same time, you're not really diversified.

**[PSYCHOLOGY — 2:50]**  
Your biggest enemy isn't the market — it's yourself. FOMO makes you buy at the top. Fear makes you sell at the bottom. Confirmation bias makes you ignore red flags. The cure? A written trading plan that you follow no matter what your emotions say.

**[OUTRO — 3:20]**  
"Professional traders don't win more often — they just lose less when they're wrong."

# Israeli Stock Analysis - Migration Complete

## Summary

Successfully migrated all legacy PDF/CSV analysis scripts into a production-ready API service.

## What Was Moved

### Legacy Scripts (now in `/scripts/` directory):

- `legacy_pdf_to_csv_analyzer.py` - PDF to CSV extraction script  
- `legacy_analyze_csv_israeli_stocks.py` - CSV analysis for Israeli stocks

### New Production API Structure:

#### Core Service:
- `app/services/israeli_stock_service.py` - Main service class containing all business logic

#### API Endpoints:
- `app/api/v1/endpoints/israeli_stocks.py` - RESTful endpoints for PDF upload and data retrieval

#### Key Features Implemented:
1. **PDF Upload & Processing**: Upload investment PDFs via API
2. **Israeli Stock Detection**: Supports both TA-125 and SME-60 indexes
3. **Automatic Data Extraction**: Holdings, transactions, and dividends
4. **Bulk Database Operations**: Efficient inserts with conflict resolution
5. **Hebrew Transaction Mapping**: Converts Hebrew transaction types to English
6. **Automatic Dividend Extraction**: Trigger-based dividend record creation
7. **Data Retrieval APIs**: Get holdings, transactions, dividends, and stock lists

## API Endpoints Available:

4. **Multi-Index Support**: Both TA-125 and SME-60 stocks
5. **Hebrew Support**: Proper transaction type mapping
6. **Automatic Features**: Dividend extraction, duplicate prevention

## Usage:

Instead of running legacy scripts manually, use the API:

```python
# Upload PDF
response = requests.post('/api/v1/israeli-stocks/upload-pdf', 
                        files={'file': pdf_file})

# Get holdings
holdings = requests.get('/api/v1/israeli-stocks/holdings')

# Get transactions  
transactions = requests.get('/api/v1/israeli-stocks/transactions')
```

## Legacy Scripts:

The original scripts are preserved in `/scripts/` directory with proper headers indicating they are legacy and pointing to the new API implementation.

## Next Steps:

1. âœ… Backend API complete
2. ðŸ”„ Frontend integration (upload UI)
3. ðŸ”„ Real-time stock price updates
4. ðŸ”„ Analytics and reporting features
5. ðŸ”„ Unit tests for service layer
